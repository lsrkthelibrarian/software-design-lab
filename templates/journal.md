# Lauren's Technical Journal

## Week One (1/30 to 2/5)

This week I spent some time getting familiar with the command line.  I had taken the GCDRI in early January, but it had been several weeks since I had opened the command line again.  I reviewed the tutorials that were included in the institute and linked out from the syllabus.  

Hour 1: Practice opening the command line and running simple commands like cd, ls, pwd, cd .., etc.
Hour 2: Reviewed my repository content that had been forked from the syllabus
Hour 3: More simple commands on the command line.  I think I've mastered pwd, ls, cd, cd ..

## Week Two (2/6 to 2/12)

This week, I really wanted to spend time pulling and pushing to git, but I didn't quite get there.  I had to first spend time mastering how to open a file from the command line in VS Code since I couldn't remember.  I also wanted to go through a bit of the Python Tutorial, which I did a little of, but it was intimidating, so I didn't do as much as I wanted to.  A classmate helped me remeber how to open a file from the command line in VS Code right before class by typing: "code" before the file name.  

Hour 1: Continued to practice opening the command line and running simple commands like cd, ls, pwd, cd .., etc.
Hour 2: Tried to follow the python tutorial, but I couldn't get the text file to open in VS Code and the tutorial said I couldn't use the program that it kept opening in.  I panicked a bit, but a classmate helped me out before class to figure out what I was doing wrong!  I did try and look it up on the internet, but I didn't get any answers that made sense.  Thanks to my classmate!
Hour 3: Reviewed and viewed a bit more of the Python tutorial, but didn't get too far.

## Week Three (2/13 to 2/19)

This week I want to master the git add, commit, and push so that my files can stay up to date.  I plan to add, commit and push a few different days this week to ensure that I master it.

Hour 1: Stayed after class to review how to add, commit, and push to git and to ensure that my repository was connected.  I made sure to take careful notes of how to complete this on my own.
Hour 2: Updated my goals, which I'm not sure if I'm on the right track with, but I did use the opportunity of drafting the goals and benchmarks by using the git add, commit, and push function many times.  I look forward to your feedback!
Hour 3: Working on journals for the last three weeks.  I plan to be better with updating this as the course goes on.  Turns out that I didn't do it properly on my first try, so I had to do it again.  Thus I am adding this last statement to clarify that I haven't yet mastered the add, commit, push.  I'll try again!  Another update: SUCCESS!

## Week Four (2/20 to 2/26)

This week I want to work more with Python. Complete the tutorials!  I also want to finish the optional tutorials on HTML.  Also, update my HTML site.  

Extremely tardy update:  I did not get to do much of this work when I wanted to.  Work, travel, and life have gotten in the way and I am not circling back to continue on progressing through the course.  

## Week Five (2/27 to 3/5)

I had to miss class this week due to attendance at a conference.  This travel has put me even further behind.  Not what I was hoping for at this point in the semester.  I've been following along in class and really enjoying the lab time we have in class, but I realize this is not all that I need to do to be successful in this class.  I am going to continue to follow along with the "at-home" lab work.

## Week Five (3/6 to 3/12)

I got sick in class this week and luckily made it through the session, but was unable to do ANY work.  

## Week Six (3/13 to 3/19)

I had to miss class this week, again, due to my illness.  I was wiped out for a week and a half.  This has put me severly behind, but as of this writing on 3/24, I am finally feeling better and ready to begin the process of catching up on missed work.  This week, I am going to go back to Week four and start over.  

## Week Seven (3/20 to 3/26)
This week is when we have an assignment due.  I'm a little unsure of what I will submit as I've fallen behind, but I think after doing some work to catch up, I will have a better idea of what to propose.  

3/25/19 I've spent about an hour in the Learning the Python the Hardway tutorial and i know that Zed is using a different version of Python and a different text editor, but so far that hasn't been too big of a deal.  I realized that in order to print anything using his directions, I had to add a "()" around the string.  I've now gotten to Exercise 5 where he introduces "More Variables and Printing" and is using the "%" symbol to demonstrate a format string by using specialized format sequences.  However, I can't get it to work and when I google the error I am getting "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'NoneType' and 'str'" I do not understand what the instructions for updating this are.  I am now thinking that it's possibly an issue with the disparate versions of python??!!  I am hesitant to move on before mastering this part of the lesson.  I am going to move on to the next Lab Resource and attempt to learn specialized formatting of strings!

I should say that I am very comfortable opening and using the command line now.  And by very comfortable, I mean not scared of it at all.  I look forward to a challenge that shakes me a little and disrupts my comfort.  I've been using the tab and space key to toggle between programs and this, if nothing else, is the most useful skill I've acquired so far! :-)

3/26/19 I'm now working on the Wikibooks Tutorial for learning python.  I made my first mistake where I can learn from.  When defining a variable and then trying to print it on the command line, quote marks are NOT needed.  Okay, back to the tutorial now...

I've spent another hour going through the Wikibooks tutorial and was able to get the %s special formatting to work this time, but not sure why!  I'm now stuck on the Exercises in the Variables and Strings tutorial!  I'm going to continue to tackle the exercises and also to take the Quiz at the end.  I like that there are assessments built into this tutorial!

## Week Eight (3/27 to 4/2)
