# $Lauren's Technical Journal

## Week One (1/30 to 2/5)

This week I spent some time getting familiar with the command line.  I had taken the GCDRI in early January, but it had been several weeks since I had opened the command line again.  I reviewed the tutorials that were included in the institute and linked out from the syllabus.  

Hour 1: Practice opening the command line and running simple commands like cd, ls, pwd, cd .., etc.
Hour 2: Reviewed my repository content that had been forked from the syllabus
Hour 3: More simple commands on the command line.  I think I've mastered pwd, ls, cd, cd ..

## Week Two (2/6 to 2/12)

This week, I really wanted to spend time pulling and pushing to git, but I didn't quite get there.  I had to first spend time mastering how to open a file from the command line in VS Code since I couldn't remember.  I also wanted to go through a bit of the Python Tutorial, which I did a little of, but it was intimidating, so I didn't do as much as I wanted to.  A classmate helped me remeber how to open a file from the command line in VS Code right before class by typing: "code" before the file name.  

Hour 1: Continued to practice opening the command line and running simple commands like cd, ls, pwd, cd .., etc.
Hour 2: Tried to follow the python tutorial, but I couldn't get the text file to open in VS Code and the tutorial said I couldn't use the program that it kept opening in.  I panicked a bit, but a classmate helped me out before class to figure out what I was doing wrong!  I did try and look it up on the internet, but I didn't get any answers that made sense.  Thanks to my classmate!
Hour 3: Reviewed and viewed a bit more of the Python tutorial, but didn't get too far.

## Week Three (2/13 to 2/19)

This week I want to master the git add, commit, and push so that my files can stay up to date.  I plan to add, commit and push a few different days this week to ensure that I master it.

Hour 1: Stayed after class to review how to add, commit, and push to git and to ensure that my repository was connected.  I made sure to take careful notes of how to complete this on my own.
Hour 2: Updated my goals, which I'm not sure if I'm on the right track with, but I did use the opportunity of drafting the goals and benchmarks by using the git add, commit, and push function many times.  I look forward to your feedback!
Hour 3: Working on journals for the last three weeks.  I plan to be better with updating this as the course goes on.  Turns out that I didn't do it properly on my first try, so I had to do it again.  Thus I am adding this last statement to clarify that I haven't yet mastered the add, commit, push.  I'll try again!
