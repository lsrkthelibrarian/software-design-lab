# Call for a programmer
The [Zine Union Catalog](www.zinecat.org) (aka ZineCat or ZUC) is in need of a website programmer to make a professional, static site, that details the activity of the Zine Union Catalog and provide clear information about the project and its creators.  The site will be used as the project's main point of entry and for marketing purposes to get the word out about the Zine Union Catalog.  

# About the project
The site will be created using HTML and CSS and will require working closely with the client (creators of ZineCat) to develop content, design, and build the site according to web design best practices.  Accessibility is of the utmost importance for this project.  Additionally, the clients would like to make the process of creating this site available to potential visitors, so thorough, and open, documentation should be kept to log the site's development.  The client will also require guidance on where to host the site and how it can best integrate the other elements of the project that have a presence online (i.e. social media).  Potential programmers should be aware that ZineCat is a work in progress and client will need to have access to the site to make updates and edits into the future.   

## Basic website frame
The following are the pages required in the initial deployment of the website:
* Home Page
* About Us
* How to get involved (that includes information on ZineCat's [Git Hub repo](https://github.com/lsrkthelibrarian/zinecat.org))
* Follow us that includes information on Twitter, Facebook, and Blog
* How to access the Zine Union Catalog: [www.zinecat.org](www.zinecat.org)
* Links and readings
* Behind the scenes (that provides insight into creating the website and should also include a statement of commitment to accessibility and reusability) - this is somewhat optional

# More about the project:
[Zinecat.org](www.zinecat.org) is a union catalog dedicated to *zines*! A union catalog is a resource where libraries can share cataloging and holdings information. The Zine Union Catalog (ZUC) lets researchers discover zine holdings by searching a single catalog, and helps librarians copy catalog records to facilitate lending across libraries. ZUC serves educators, researchers, librarians, archivists, and anyone in the general public with an interest in zines.  It is a work in progress and supported by [The CUNY Graduate Center's MA in Digital Humanities](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Masters-Programs/Digital-Humanities) program.  

# More about why it is important:
According to the [Barnard Zine Collection's website](https://zines.barnard.edu/about-zines), a **zine**, short for fanzine or magazine, is a DIY* subculture self-publication, usually made on paper and reproduced with a photocopier or printer. Zine creators are often motivated by a desire to share knowledge or experience with people in marginalized or otherwise less-empowered communities. (* DIY = do it yourself)

Zines are increasingly recognized as important for scholarship & cultural memory and understanding.  Libraries and cultural institutions are collecting zines in growing numbers.  There is no one interface to search for zines and zine collections, so the Zine Union Catalog aims to provide the one search interface.  The ZUC is similar to [WorldCat](www.worldcat.org) or the [Digital Public Library of America](https://dp.la/).  The client believes this project is very meaningful and hopes to find a programmer that is interested in getting involved with ZUC in its early stages of development.  

# More about the client:
[Lauren Kehoe](https://library.nyu.edu/people/lauren-kehoe/) is a librarian at NYU and a student at the CUNY Graduate Center in its MA in Digital Humanities program.  She has been working with [Jenna Freedman](https://lowereastsidelibrarian.info/), Zine Librarian at Barnard and graduate student, on building the Zine Union Catalog since 2017 (along with other members of the zine and zine library communities).  Lauren is the co-lead on the project and appreciates any contributions made in support of this project.  In this instance, Lauren is asking for a programmer to build a basic website that will act as the landing site for ZineCat.  Please contact Lauren at zinecatproject@gmail.com
